## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation framework for studying virus capsid assembly, specifically focusing on the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). The codebase utilizes a half-edge data structure for efficient geometric computations and assembly simulations.

## Model Description
The simulation framework implements a multiscale model of HBV capsid assembly that:
- Represents capsid proteins and their interactions at a coarse-grained level
- Incorporates thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of assembly
- Accounts for the dimorphic nature of HBV capsids (T=3 and T=4)
- Uses GCMC to sample different assembly states and configurations

### Key Features
- **Half-edge Data Structure**: Efficient representation of dimer subunits using a doubly connected edge list (DCEL)
- **Two Edge Types**: 
  - AB edge (AB and BA half-edges) representing AB dimer conformation
  - CD edge (CD and DC half-edges) representing CD/CC dimer conformation
- **Conformation-Dependent Interactions**: Different binding affinities for various dimer-dimer interactions
- **Elastic Energy Model**: Incorporates stretching, bending, and binding angle moduli


## Key Findings
Our model captures key biophysical characteristics of HBV capsid assembly and offers insights into its polymorphic behavior. Specifically, we observe:

1. **Assembly Pathways**: The simulation framework reproduces experimentally observed assembly trajectories, including the formation of both T=3 and T=4 icosahedral capsids.

2. **Polymorphism Control**: The model highlights how capsid polymorphism emerges from a combination of factors:

- The underlying conformational energy landscape 
- Variations in dimer-dimer binding affinities
- Coupling between protein conformation and interaction specificity

3. **Ionic Strength Effects**: Simulations reveal that higher ionic strengths favor the assembly of T=3 structures, suggesting a shift in conformational equilibrium toward CD dimer formation under these conditions.
