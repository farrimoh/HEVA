## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation framework for studying virus capsid assembly, specifically focusing on the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). The codebase utilizes a half-edge data structure for efficient geometric computations and assembly simulations.

## Model Description
The simulation framework implements a multiscale model of HBV capsid assembly that:
- Represents capsid proteins and their interactions at a coarse-grained level
- Incorporates thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of assembly
- Accounts for the dimorphic nature of HBV capsids (T=3 and T=4)
- Uses GCMC to sample different assembly states and configurations

### Key Features
- **Half-edge Data Structure**: Efficient representation of dimer subunits using a doubly connected edge list (DCEL)
- **Two Edge Types**: 
  - AB edge (AB and BA half-edges) representing AB dimer conformation
  - CD edge (CD and DC half-edges) representing CD/CC dimer conformation
- **Conformation-Dependent Interactions**: Different binding affinities for various dimer-dimer interactions
- **Elastic Energy Model**: Incorporates stretching, bending, and binding angle moduli

### Energy Model
The total energy of a capsid configuration is given by:
```
H_capsid = H_elastic + H_steric + H_bind + H_conf
```
where:
- `H_elastic`: Elastic energy from edge length, dihedral angle, and binding angle fluctuations
- `H_steric`: Excluded volume interactions
- `H_bind`: Binding energy between dimer pairs
- `H_conf`: Conformational free energy landscape

## Key Findings
Based on the research published in [Multiscale Modeling of Hepatitis B Virus Capsid Assembly and Its Dimorphism](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.2c02119):

1. **Assembly Pathways**: The model successfully reproduces experimental observations of HBV assembly pathways and products, including T=3 and T=4 icosahedral structures.

2. **Polymorphism Control**: Capsid polymorphism is promoted by the low HBV capsid bending modulus, with key factors being:
   - Conformational energy landscape
   - Protein-protein binding affinities
   - Coupling between protein conformational state and interactions

3. **Ionic Strength Effects**: Higher proportions of T=3 capsids assemble at higher ionic strengths, suggesting that salt concentration shifts the conformational equilibrium toward CD dimer conformations.
